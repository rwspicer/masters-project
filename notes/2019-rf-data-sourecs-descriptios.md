# Early Winter Precip (oct-nov) (year N)
* Description:
        
    Early winter precipitation is used as a possible driving factor in thermokarst as it is thought that high precipitation at the start of winter will insulate the ground preventing active layer from freezing 
* units: mm
* source: http://ckan.snap.uaf.edu/dataset/historical-monthly-precipitation-1-km-cru-ts
* processing: Original data is in a monthly format. The months of Oct and Nov are added together to create the data used.

# full Winter Precip (oct-mar) (year N)
* Description:
        
    full winter precipitation is used as a possible driving factor in thermokarst as it is thought that high precipitation at the start of winter will continuously insulate the ground preventing active layer from freezing 

* units: mm

* processing: Original data is in a monthly format. The months of Oct through Mar are added together to create the data used.

# Winter Temperature (year N)
* Description:
        
    High winter temperatures may prevent the freezing of the active layer leading to thermokarst initiation. 

* units: FDD
* source: http://ckan.snap.uaf.edu/dataset/historical-monthly-temperature-1-km-cru-ts
* processing: Original data is in a monthly format.  A spline thing is done to calculate the Freezing degree days for each winter 


# Summer Temperature (year N+1)
* Description:
        
    High summer temperatures cause extreme thawing in permafrost.

* units: FDD
* source: http://ckan.snap.uaf.edu/dataset/historical-monthly-temperature-1-km-cru-ts
* processing: Original data is in a monthly format.  A spline thing is done to calculate the Thawing degree days for each summer

# Summer Temperature (year N)
* Description:
        
    High summer temperatures cause extreme thawing in permafrost, and lead to a large active layer going into the following winter
