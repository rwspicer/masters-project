Landscape change in permafrost regions, caused by thermokarst, can result in profound impacts on the water, energy, and carbon fluxes; wildlife habitats; and infrastructure. The Alaska Thermokarst Model (ATM) is an intermediate scale state and transition model designed to simulate land scape transitions caused by thermokarst disturbance. Landscape units (cohorts) are tracked on a grid based subdivision of the model area. Landscape changes from the current cohort to the next are determined using a logic based rule set. Thermokarst Initiation, or the start of a major landscape shift due to ice wedge degradation, is thought to be caused by extreme climatic events. Identifying regions susceptible to this Thermokarst Initiation is important for refining the logic rules used in the ATM. Analysis undertaken to identify these regions for the Alaskan Arctic Costal Plain includes finding areas where the following conditions are greater than the 1901-1950 average: early winter(Oct,Nov total) precipitation, full winter precipitation(Oct - Mar total) winter temperatures (measured as Freezing Degree Days), and summer temperatures (Thawing Degree Days). The percent difference from average for each of these measures is then added together to find regions where thermokarst Initiation is likely for any given year. This analysis is also compared to previous Thermokarst predisposition studies to eliminate areas where thermokarst is not known to occur.
